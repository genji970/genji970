## Hi there 👋

I'm a undergraduate student(4th year) at **Korea University** working on **3D Gaussian Splatting**.  
Right now I'm training **Mip-NeRF360** scenes using **COLMAP + Gaussian Splatting** (referencing *3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering*). Making 
customized 3d gs generating pipeline.

### My interest
multimodal, 3d vision, RL , LLM

### 🔭 Currently
- Building a COLMAP → GS training/rendering pipeline for Mip-NeRF360.

### 📖 Recently Reading
- **3D Gaussian Splatting** papers

### 🎓 Coursework (2022–2023)
- Math major: **Analysis2**, **Differential Geometry**, **Topology2**...
- CS major: **Algorithms**, **Artificial Intelligence**...

### 🧠 How I Learn
- I read research papers and see many full university/graduate-level course series on YouTube (professors’ complete lecture playlists).

### 🧩 Open Source
- **Ultralytics YOLO** contributor — **2 merged PRs**.

### ⚙️ Tech
Python · C++(little) · PyTorch · OpenCV · COLMAP · 3D · GS · rl · llm · docker(little) 


image gained by training with my custome pipeline without using the whole 3d gs opensource.
To handle oom issue, there need some idea.
